# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As a project that seeks to foster collaboration and learning, we pledge to make participation a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We especially value new contributors and commit to creating an environment where everyone can learn, experiment, and grow together.

* **Using welcoming and inclusive language**
* **Being collaborative** and helping others learn and contribute

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of representing our project include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to actions taken outside of these spaces when the behavior has the potential to negatively affect the safety and well-being of project participants.

## Reporting Guidelines

### How to Report

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the project team at:

**Email:** irae45@gmail.com  
**GitHub Issues:** For less sensitive public reports  

As this is a small project, we will do our best to respond quickly and fairly. If you are the sole maintainer, consider asking a trusted collaborator to act as an alternative contact.
